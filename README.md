### (Input images are included)

1. **Gaussian blurring**:
   This folder contains code for Gaussian Blurring algorithm using pure python and PIL library for reading/writing images.
   Fours combinations of kernel_size and sigma are used to apply blur of different magnitude.

2. **Histogram equalization**:
   This folder contains code for Histogram Equalization, which helps to make an image more 'pronounced' - make white pixels a bit more darker and black pixels a bit more brighter.
   This way the image becomes more well-defined.
